## Question 1
We take a random sample of individuals in a population and identify whether they smoke and if they have cancer. 
We observe that there is a strong relationship between whether a person in the sample smoked or not and whether they have lung cancer. 
We claim that the smoking is related to lung cancer in the larger population. 
We explain we think that the reason for this relationship is because cigarette smoke contains known carcinogens such as arsenic 
and benzene, which make cells in the lungs become cancerous.
## Solution 
This is an example of an inferential data analysis. 
Because it uses a sample data to a general conclusion among big population

## Question 2
What is the most important thing in Data Science?
## Solution
The question you are trying to answer.
Because we should formaulate the question in advance. Then data is the 2nd important thing.

## Question 3
If the goal of a study was to relate Martha Stewart Living Subscribers to Our Site's Users based on the number 
of people that lived in each region of the US, what would be the potential problem? 
##Soulution
There would be confounding because the number of people that live in an area is related to both Martha Stewart
Living Subscribers and Our Site's Users.
This is similar with the example to explain the confounding concept. 

##Question 4
What is an experimental design tool that can be used to address variables that may be confounders at the design
phase of an experiment?
##Solution
Randomization.
##Question 5
What is the reason behind the explosion of interest in big data?
## Solution
The price and difficulty of collecting and storing data has dramatically dropped.
